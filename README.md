# Analyzing and AB Testing

### Project details:
For this project, I used AB testing and linear regression. To understand customers' behavior to help a company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### A/B test:

* In A/B test we set up our hypothesis to test if new page results in better conversion or not.
* We will simulate our user groups with respect to conversions.
* We will find the the p_value.
* We will also use an alternative approach to validate / double check our results and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
